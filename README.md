5000 posts were used per month for the political dataset. This data wasÂ used to determine the average growth rate of the community and how a single post may do based on several factors used in growth analysis, these factors include month, follower count, favorite count, and retweet count. These factors combine to provide a basis for the prediction of growth in a community based on normal growth factors.
